                        <h3>Battle of Fort Sumter</h3>
                        <p>Southern states disliked Lincoln as president, as a result: 7 states seceded starting with South Carolina. 6 more states followed creating the Confederate states of America. They requested Lincoln to surrender the United states property to them. Lincoln did not and sent supplies (not troops or weapons because he didn’t want war.) to Fort Sumter. The supply ship was sent away, so there were negotiations between the Fort Sumter commander and a Confederate General which failed. Then on April 9th president of the Confederates: President Jefferson Davis, wanted to strike Fort Sumter. The order was given on the 10th to strike and after a stalemate, of staring, confederate guns started to fire on the 12th. Casualties: none. Union: 80 troops. Confederates: 500 troops.
